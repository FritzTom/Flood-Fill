# Flood Fill
`Quick Fill` and it's completely different but also still `quick fill`

## Rawr
for quick fill functionality (just drawing a rect) just select 2 objs a click

for flood fill select an center object and click the button, then select ur outline and click again
btw flood fill only works within the max bounds of ur outline selection so its not gonna fill the whole lvl yk
